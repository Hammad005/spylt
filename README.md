# ⚡ GSAP with React

This project demonstrates how to integrate **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** with **React** to create smooth, high-performance animations.

## 🚀 What is GSAP?

**GSAP** is a powerful JavaScript animation library used for building highly performant and visually appealing animations. It works with DOM elements, CSS properties, SVG, Canvas, and more.

> GSAP is widely used in web development for interactive UIs and complex motion graphics.

## ⚛️ Why Use GSAP with React?

While React excels at managing UI state and structure, it doesn’t handle complex animations well on its own. GSAP bridges that gap by giving you fine-grained control over animations.

**Benefits:**
- GPU-accelerated, buttery smooth animations
- Sequencing and timelines with `gsap.timeline()`
- Advanced easing
- SVG support
- Scroll-based animations (with plugins like `ScrollTrigger`)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react
